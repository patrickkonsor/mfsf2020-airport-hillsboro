# mfsf2020-airport-hillsboro

A mostly-correct update to KHIO Portland-Hillsboro airport for MSFS 2020. Download the "airport-khio-hillsboro" directory from Packages into your Community folder, and re-start MSFS2020. The source is available in the Project directory.

- Adds missing runway 13L/31R
- Adds all missing taxiways and correct naming
- Adds realistic aircraft parking locations
- Probably a bunch of other fixes
